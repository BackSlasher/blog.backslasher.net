## Background
I'm an avid programmer and  spent the last 6+ years at Facebook as a Production Engineer (also known as SRE in other places), where I helped multiple teams make their services more reliable, squeeze more out of the hardware, and generally do more with less. 
In my free time I help non-profits and work on automating my home.  
I help businesses deliver robust, scalable and performant services. 
If you think we should work together, drop me a line!

 
## Things I do well
 
1. Automate all the things  
    Whether we're talking about discovering leaked user PII in debug logs or turning on the heating on a chilly morning, I automate manualwork so people can spend time on something more interesting.
1. Design robust, elastic, highly-available systems and processes  
    Thinking about how things can break (and how we can prevent that breakage) is a required step in designing something that will not break unexpectedly once deployed.
    
1. Firefighting and fire drills  
    There is a significant difference between firefighting with and without preparation. With forward thinking, you can prepare your monitoring, documentation, on-call rotation, and tooling and sleep easy, knowing that if something breaks at 3 am, your team will be ready.
    
1. Solving special problems  
    Some of your problems may be outside your team's area of expertise. Maybe it's a cross-service 'no-man's land', maybe it touches the infrastructure too much for comfort, [maybe it just won't print on Tuesdays](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/cupsys/+bug/255161/comments/28). I like these problems, and I like solving them even better.
